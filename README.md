# Sew Select

I love to sew, and I have a hard time keeping track of my fabrics and patterns. Specifically, which fabrics I have enough of for a specific pattern, or which pattern I can use with a type of fabric. 

I decided to create a website where I can upload my inventory of fabric and patterns. This website is Sew Select. It will allow me to filter by fabric or pattern, and match them up based on their matching characteristics (for example: if a pattern needs at least 4 yards of knit - aka stretchy - material, it will only display fabric that is knit and has at least 4 yards. If I click on a woven fabric with 2 yards remaining, the site will only display patterns that I can make with that amount and type of fabric).

Not only will this be useful to me in my sewing, this website is a great opportunity to learn some new skills, and to practice my current ones.
